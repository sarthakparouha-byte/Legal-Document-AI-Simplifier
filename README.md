## Problem Statement

Legal documents are pervasive in business, government, contracts, and more — but they are often full of dense legalese, complex wording, and jargon. Most people:

- don’t have legal training  
- struggle to understand their rights / obligations  
- feel frustrated or unsure about what they're signing

Current alternatives are either expensive legal consultations or generic AI tools that don’t understand legal context, leaving many to “sign blindly.”

---

## Solution

We aim to democratize legal understanding by offering:

- **Instant Document Analysis** using Google Gemini 1.5-Flash  
- **Plain-English Summaries** for better understanding  
- **Key Clause Extraction** along with detailed explanations  
- **Risk Assessment** to flag potential issues  
- **Interactive Q&A** for querying specific parts of a document

---

## Key Features

- Support for **PDF, DOC, and TXT** document uploads  
- Multi-step wizard interface with separate tabs: Summary, Key Clauses, Risk Assessment, Q&A  
- Visualization/help with legal terms & explanations  

---

## Current Prototype

- **Document Upload** capability (PDF, DOC, TXT)  
- Integrated with **Google Gemini** for document understanding & generating summaries / clause extraction / risk evaluation  
- Basic user interface to view summaries, key clauses, risk assessment, and ask questions interactively  

---

## Planned Enhancements

- Add **Photo Upload & OCR**: Take images of documents and convert them to text for processing  
- Add **User Authentication**: Secure login, personal document libraries  
- Predefined Q&A templates depending on document type to help users ask smarter questions
